### **🔥 30-45 Minute HTML & CSS Coding Challenge: Build a Responsive Card Grid with Hover Effects**

#### **🚀 Challenge Overview:**  
You'll build a **responsive card grid** that showcases different fruit items. Each card should contain:
✅ An image  
✅ A title  
✅ A short description  
✅ A button that changes color on hover  

The layout should be **flexible**—it should display **three cards in a row** on larger screens and **stack them in a column** on smaller screens.

---

### **📜 Requirements:**
#### **📌 HTML**
- Use **semantic elements** (e.g., `<section>`, `<article>`).
- Each **card** should be wrapped in a `<div>` inside a `.card-container`.
- Add at least **4 different fruit cards**.

#### **🎨 CSS**
- Use **flexbox** for the card layout.
- Ensure the **cards are responsive** (3 in a row on larger screens, 1 in a row on smaller screens).
- Apply **hover effects**:
  - The **card should slightly scale up on hover**.
  - The **button should change color when hovered**.
- Add **rounded images** with a subtle shadow.
- Use **consistent font styling**.

### **🏆 Bonus Challenges (If You Have Extra Time!)**
✅ Make the **cards animate smoothly** when hovered over using `transition`.  
✅ Add **a simple media query** to adjust styles for mobile screens.  
✅ Use **Google Fonts** to enhance the typography.
